Algorithm

1. Download necessary files and create maze.js file
2. Popup alert box when user clicks on start.
3. Modify txt inside on element when user clicks on end. 
4. Change boundary block color of all classes that have "boundary"
as class value to red when user hover over any wall and declare looser.
5. Keep track of "You win!".
6. Once you win, lock all cells or lock blocks & color to avoid false alarm.
7.  s = hover = game starts
    s = click = game resets
8. After the user hovers over the start icon, start timer and call the function
   that declares looser if the game has not yet won
9. check boundary to avoid cheating.
